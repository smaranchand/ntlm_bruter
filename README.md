NTLM Bruter is a simple tool that bruteforces the usernames/passwords against the application with HTTP NTLM Authentication.
The tool tries all possible combinations from ```usernames.txt``` and ```passwords.txt``` files to enumerate the correct set of credentials.


Usage: ```python3 ntlm.py [Target_URL] [AD_Domain_Name]```

Note: It is highly recommended to use your own wordlists.
